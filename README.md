Here is my reflection questions:

Q:What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
A:Alternative text for image, because it is not visuable unless you do not have a image.

Q:How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
A:ARIA attributes enhance the experience for users relying on assistive technologies by providing additional information about web content and user interface components.

Q:What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
A:I used background-color to make it so much easier to read.
